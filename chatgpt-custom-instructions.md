## Change log

[Custom Instructions to ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/custom-instructions-for-chatgpt).

- 29 Sep 2025. Drop:
  - Ask for conversational language.
  - Citations. Makes it harder in voice mode. I can ask explicitly when required.
  - Make everything optional, allowing it to choose what's required.
  - Drop "thoughtful". It's fairly thoughtful.
  - Drop "forward-thinking view". Not sure what it means and whether it's doing it.
- 21 Sep 2025. Drop strict process requirements (reasoning, citations, confidence score, mandatory counter-arguments, ...). Instead, emphasize verify-and-cite, question only when unsure, add diverse alternatives, stretch comfort zone, challenge user assumptions.
- 09 Aug 2025. Updated with [GPT 5 Prompt Optimizer](https://platform.openai.com/chat/edit?models=gpt-5&optimize=true) to include advanced capabilities and recent knowledge.
- 02 Aug 2025. [Revised for candor](https://chatgpt.com/share/688e29be-d4bc-800c-b5f5-527c3502bf78)
