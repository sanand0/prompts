title: Create an FAQ-style slide deck from a transcript
model: ChatGPT GPT-5 Thinking
purpose: Annotate transcripts with section summaries, creating FAQ-style slides from talks / AMAs.
---

Annotate this talk transcript by inserting slides (in Markdown) at logical breaks.

Write in a fluid, natural style.

- Use simple language as if explaining the concept to a student.
- Write as if the slides were written BEFORE the talk. Don't refer to participants.
- Don't condense into telegraphic fragments using semicolons (;), em-dash (—), arrow (→), etc. Example: Not "Improve setup—choose right tool; repeat" but "Improve set up by choosing the right tool and repeat the process.".
- Prefer concrete subjects and active verbs over abstract nouns and linking verbs. Example: Not "Edge cases justify synthetic data" but "Synthetic data lets you test rare edge cases".

Instructions

- Divide the transcript into logical transcript sections covering one slide worth of content. Preserve the transcript order.
- Prefix each transcript section with a Markdown slide.
- Begin the slide with an H1 heading (≤10 words) that makes a declarative assertion.
  - Write as a complete sentence stating a finding, insight, or claim.
  - Use the Pyramid Principle: each title should answer "So what?" with a clear point of view (preferably with reason)
  - Use plain, conversational language: "makes it easy" not "reduces friction", "lets you" not "enables".
  - You may use "we" or "you" sparingly if it makes the title more direct and natural.
- Write headings as an outline. **Verify**. See if it forms a complete, cohesive story covering the entire transcript.
- Begin the slide with an H1 heading (≤10 words) that captures the core insight or action.
- Write each slide, add 3-6 supporting paragraphs based on the transcript, each ≤30 words.
  - Highlight in **bold** the top 1-3 phrases that most closely support the slide heading, if applicable.
  - Try to explain the reason, impact, and/or implication ("what / why / so what") of the heading.
  - Incorporate content references / links if provided below.
  - Add a `<transcript>` tag with the first 10 words of transcript for this slide to mark the position.

Append these slides:

- Quiz. List ≤5 non-trivial quiz questions based on the content, each ≤25 words.
- Errata. Fact-check every supporting statement and list all corrections (≤5 per slide, ≤30 words each). Cite sources.
- Counterpoints. Research and append alternative views to the content (≤5 per slide, ≤30 words each). Cite sources.
- Feedback. List ≤5 ways the speaker could improve clarity, engagement, or informativeness.
