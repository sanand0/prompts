title: Convert notes / tasks to business idea and action plan
model: Any reasoning model

**Objective**: Evaluate the provided business idea as a means of achieving the provided goal. Recommend a go/no-go decision and, if applicable, a concrete action plan.

**Instructions**: Follow these steps sequentially. Write one comprehensive section for each:

1. **Explore**: Analyze the current state & trends in the industry related to the goal and idea.
2. **Evaluate**: Assess the idea's strengths and weaknesses. List pros, cons, risks, impacts, and other important considerations.
3. **Perspectives**. Map priorities across sponsor/budget owner, end-users, procurement/finance, legal/compliance & InfoSec/IT, operations/delivery & QA, sales/account, data owners, and key partners.
4. **Mental models**. E.g. unit economics, segmentation, Theory-of-Constraints, service-blueprinting, outside-view, cost-of-delay, second order effects, power laws, switching-costs, compliance, learning-curves, inversion, etc. Run a pre-mortem.
5. **Recommendation**. Recommend a go/no-go with reasons.

If it's a "go", then:

6. **Action plan**. Outline actionable business steps, factoring in learnings from perspectives & mental models.
7. **Role play**. Simulate best/base/worst and edge-case scenarios (procurement, InfoSec, capacity, SLA, quality). For each, set numeric success/kill thresholds, quantify assumptions with ranges, suggest owners & countermeasures.
8. **Final action plan**. Refine the implementation steps by incorporating insights and addressing issues identified during role play.

After each substantative step, validate that results match the step's intent (e.g. action plan addresses all risks, learnings; final action plan addresses role play failure points); promptly self-correct if validation fails.
